title: "SIPS 2021 Unconference: 
‘Improving Registered Reports for authors, reviewers and editors’
"
subtitle: "Summary from the discussion at the [SIPS session](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1l-WvrZyA67SjJUHX_kWn2PJHMDfWCvQCBfKNRTSnarA/edit?usp=sharing) in 2021 on improving Registered Reports."
summary: "For this SIPS unconference session we invited researchers from all career levels to discuss how we can improve Registered Reports (RRs) for authors, reviewers, and editors. Discussion themes included addressing the key challenges surrounding the adoption and implementation of RRs, expanding the format for more types of research, and increasing their overall accessibility. The insights gained from this discussion will be used to guide improvements to the RR process and quality of RRs being published (e.g. RRs study design template, community feedback, quality monitoring)."

<h2>Direct Replications & Registered Reports</h2>

<p align="justify">
Registered Reports (RRs) often involve direct replications of original studies that are peer-reviewed before the research is conducted and are published irrespective of the results if they receive in-principle acceptance (IPA). A key issue was identified with the RR process that may require clarification in terms of journal guidelines and improvement from the authors’ perspective. Session participants shared their experiences on challenges they encountered when the original author(s) of the study were involved in the peer-review process and requested changes to methods and/or analyses.</p> 

<p align="justify">We agreed that the original authors’ involvement may well depend on the purpose of the replication, as for example whether it is only a specific study protocol or the generalisability of the claims the authors made in their original research. In the latter scenario, the input of the original authors may be paramount for clarifying which parameters have to be considered for generalisation (e.g. sample or specific stimuli used in an experiment). In theory, such generalisability clarifications should be added to original research to allow for well-constructed and clearly interpreted direct replications.</p>

<p align="justify">To avoid such problems in the future there could be clear guidelines that the editorial teams have to follow regarding the <b>involvement of the original authors in the peer-review process</b>. For example, should they be invited to provide a full review of the Stage 1 proposal or simply be invited to check the RRR protocol for misinterpretations of the methods and/or claims? Such guidelines should ideally involve editorial actions that can prevent or resolve the influence of bias and potential conflicts of interest in the peer-review process. Editorial guidelines could also emphasize that exclusion requests by the authors should be honoured when appropriate - e.g. accept an exclusion request when there is known conflict between the authors of the original study and the replication study but not when two teams simply have competing theories and engage in scientific discourse). Another idea for improving this process was publishing the reviews openly as part of the final manuscript, which could deter original authors and other reviewers from requesting too many deviations from the original protocol or negatively bias the RR process.</p>

<h2>Reducing the peer-review time at Stage 1</h2>

<p align="justify">The time for a Stage 1 RR proposal to be thoroughly peer-reviewed and receive IPA may vary across journals and types of research. It is also a very general issue that was mentioned throughout different topics (e.g. from a reviewers’ perspective) including the overall accessibility of RRs. For ECRs and other researchers that are employed on short-term contracts and have limited time and/or funding to collect data the total peer-review time can add a significant burden on their overall progress. The same applies to clinical areas of research where there are already potentially long time demands not only for data collection but obtaining ethics approval at Stage 1.</p>

<p align="justify">Session participants shared experiences and/or opinions about cases of ‘bureaucratic tennis’ between the editorial team (including reviewers) and an ethics committee. The requirement for RRs to have ethics approval when a Stage 1 proposal is first submitted may very well be problematic for clinical research, where ethics approval can sometimes take up to 6 months, and for multi-lab studies which require ethics from more than one institution and other cases that are not listed here. If Stage 1 peer-review results in any major revisions to the methods, authors may still need to submit amendments to their approved Ethics. At least as a first step, journal guidelines should accommodate for such cases and provide the authors with the <b>flexibility to provide a statement regarding ethics approval when IPA is received</b> (e.g. see <a href="https://rr.peercommunityin.org/help">policy in PCI RR</a>). If peer-review can last more than 4-5 months for certain manuscripts, this should not be a problem; by the time the research can actually commence the authors can receive both IPA and ethics approvals. If peer-review can last more than 4-5 months for certain manuscripts, this should not be a problem; by the time the research can actually commence the authors can receive both IPA and ethics approvals. 
</p> 

<p align="justify">A very interesting solution for reducing the time of Stage 1 peer-review could be <b>submitting ‘one-pagers’ to journals before developing a full protocol</b> that can often require time in itself (e.g. simulating data, learning about power analyses, coding checks, piloting, internal reviews with many co-authors). Similar to enquiries for submitted commentaries, reviews and opinion pieces, journals could solicit short RR proposals. This idea was discussed with regards to the implementation of a ‘custom’ RR workflow at International Review of Social Psychology (IRSP; see <a href="https://www.rips-irsp.com/about/confirmatory-reports/">https://www.rips-irsp.com/about/confirmatory-reports/</a>). This is consistent with the idea of ‘scheduled reviews’ (see <a href="https://osf.io/preprints/metaarxiv/43298/">https://osf.io/preprints/metaarxiv/43298/</a>), where authors can prepare their complete Stage 1 proposal in a pre-specified time (e.g. 6 weeks) and the reviewers’ time is booked for that time - i.e. they agree to provide a review in advance. This may mean that the time for peer-review is considerably reduced.</p>

<p align="justify">In some studies, like those of qualitative research where interview participants are recruited from special groups, data collection can take a long time and it may be impossible for researchers to wait for the IPA before starting to recruit participants in projects with time restrictions. For these scenarios, journals could provide the option for authors to apply for a data collection permission before the IPA. To receive such permission, the editorial team would have to carry out a partial review on the data collection section of the Stage 1 RR and accept the collection procedure (but leave analysis, introduction, and other parts for further evaluation).</p> 

<h2>Recognising the reviewers’ contributions</h2>

<p align="justify">A prominent discussion issue during the session was the role of the reviewers at Stage 1 and how their contributions may not be recognised in any formal manner when the final manuscript is published. The question of whether to <b>credit reviewers’ contributions using the CRediT Taxonomy</b> (<a href="https://casrai.org/credit/">https://casrai.org/credit/</a>) was difficult to answer as on the one hand ‘rewarding’ reviewers for their review by adding them as co-authors in the final output can violate existing guidelines (e.g. COPE - unless they are then replaced by other reviewers) and lead to biased reviews, but conversely not recognising their contributions when they have influenced the overall study protocol (theory, methods and/or analyses) is not ideal to say the least. Publishing the reviewers’ comments alongside the final manuscript and acknowledging their contributions can easily be implemented without presenting any conflicts of interest. At PCI RR, all reviews are published and reviewers have the option to sign, and their review gets a DOI so it is a citable object. This provides a way for reviewers to demonstrate a scholarly contribution independently of authorship. Another approach which has been proposed is to list Stage 1 reviewers who make a significant contribution to the design of a study as "Reviewer contributors", separately from the authors. The recognition of reviewers’ contributions on published RRs could also be embedded into promotion/tenure decisions. However, although not directly linked to this idea, we highlighted the potential pitfalls of favouring RRs over standard articles with the assumption that they can demonstrate greater quality and/or quantity of work when:</p>
<p align="justify"><b>(i)</b> Some types of research, such as theoretical studies (humanities) and ethnographic fieldwork (anthropology), are not currently published as RRs. Moreover, while there is a growing number of qualitative RR submissions (QRRs), it is still unknown to what extent will journals publish QRRs: because the methods of analysis and reporting in many qualitative formats involve creativity and uncertainty that cannot be verified beforehand, there may be an increased risk for Stage 2 rejects, ultimately resulting in many qualitative studies not being submitted as QRRs at all. In the future, QRRs may benefit from a special Stage 2 review procedure where the analysis is evaluated by case-specific criteria set during Stage 1. 
<b>(ii)</b> Many scholars are incentivised or even required to publish in specific journals. These journals may not support RRs, moreover, some RR positive journals have publication fees that make them out of reach for some teams. These issues may resolve along with the increasing number of RR positive journals, however, they currently set limits for many authors.</p>
